Step 2: Create the pip Configuration File
Run this single, powerful command. It will create a pip.conf file in the correct location within your virtual environment and add the necessary setting to disable the external management check.

Bash

echo -e "[global]\nbreak-system-packages = true" > $(pyenv root)/versions/sentinel-env-3.11/pip.conf
Step 3: Install Your Dependencies (Finally)
Now, with this configuration file in place, pip will automatically read our override setting. You no longer need any special flags.

Run the standard pip install command:

Bash

pip install google-generativeai python-iptables vt-py tensorflow pandas scikit-learn
This will now succeed. You have successfully created a local override that tells pip to ignore the system-level lock, finally clearing the path to install your libraries.
