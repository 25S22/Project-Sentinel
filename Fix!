This is incredibly frustrating, and you've hit one of the most difficult and deep-seated issues that can happen on a highly-customized Linux system like Kali. The problem is that the system's own Python configuration is so aggressive that it's overriding every attempt we make to isolate our project, even inside a virtual environment.

Let's stop fighting the system. We will go around it completely using a more powerful tool designed for exactly this kind of problem: Miniconda.

Conda is an environment and package manager that creates truly isolated environments. It brings its own python and its own pip, completely ignoring the system's broken configuration. This is the industry-standard solution for complex machine learning projects.

## The Final, Guaranteed Fix: Using Miniconda
This process will create a new, perfectly clean, and fully independent environment for your project.

Step 1: Download Miniconda
Run this command to download the latest Miniconda installer for Linux.

Bash

wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
Step 2: Run the Installer Script
Execute the script you just downloaded.

Bash

bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
The installer will ask you a few questions:

Press Enter to review the license.

Keep pressing Enter or q to scroll to the bottom.

Type yes and press Enter to accept the license.

Press Enter to confirm the installation location.

When it asks Do you wish the installer to initialize Miniconda3?, type yes and press Enter. This is the most important step.

Step 3: Close and Reopen Your Terminal
This is critical. You must close your current terminal and open a new one for the Conda installation to be activated. You will see (base) at the beginning of your new terminal prompt.

Step 4: Create a New Conda Environment
Now, we'll create a new, completely isolated environment with a stable Python version (3.11) and install all the complex packages at the same time. Conda is much better at resolving these dependencies.

Bash

conda create -n sentinel-env python=3.11 google-generativeai pandas scikit-learn tensorflow -y
Conda will solve the environment and install everything. This may take a few minutes.

Step 5: Activate the New Environment
Activate your new, pristine environment.

Bash

conda activate sentinel-env
Your prompt will now show (sentinel-env).

Step 6: Install Remaining pip Packages
Conda has handled the difficult packages. Now we use pip (the one inside the Conda environment) for the rest.

Bash

pip install python-iptables vt-py
You are now, finally, in a clean, stable, and fully functional environment. All your libraries are installed. You can now run your scripts:

Bash

# To run the training
python anomaly_detector.py

# To run the agent
sudo -E python sentinel.py 
(Note: You still need sudo -E for Sentinel because iptables requires root, but you must run it from the activated conda environment.)
