Okay, this screenshot gives us a lot of critical information, and it confirms a couple of things:

pyenv initial installation issue: The pyenv installer warned you: WARNING: Can not proceed with installation. Kindly remove the '/home/death/.pyenv' directory first. This means the first attempt to install pyenv failed or was incomplete, and it left behind a partial directory.

Shell incompatibility: The source ~/.bashrc command produced a cascade of errors like command not found: shopt and parse error near '&', along with the prompt looking corrupted. This definitively tells me that you are NOT using bash as your default shell; you are using zsh.

This is why some commands aren't working as expected. Many tutorials, including mine, often assume a bash shell unless specified otherwise.

## The Definitive Fix for zsh and pyenv Reinstallation
We need to properly clean up the failed pyenv installation and then configure it specifically for zsh.

Step 1: Clean Up the Failed pyenv Installation
First, let's remove the incomplete pyenv directory.

Bash

rm -rf ~/.pyenv
Step 2: Reinstall pyenv
Now, run the pyenv installer again, ensuring a clean start.

Bash

curl https://pyenv.run | bash
Step 3: Configure Your zsh Shell for pyenv
This is the most crucial step. You need to edit ~/.zshrc (your zsh configuration file) instead of ~/.bashrc.

Open your ~/.zshrc file:

Bash

nano ~/.zshrc
Now, scroll to the very end of the file and add these lines:

Bash

export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)" # This line is good practice for pyenv-virtualenv integration
Press Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter to save and exit nano.

Step 4: Load the New zsh Configuration
After modifying ~/.zshrc, you need to either close and reopen your terminal OR explicitly source it:

Bash

source ~/.zshrc
Your prompt should now look normal, and you should be able to run pyenv commands.

Step 5: Install Python 3.11
Now, try installing Python 3.11 again. This step will still take some time as pyenv compiles Python.

Bash

pyenv install 3.11.8
Step 6: Create the New Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies
Once Python 3.11.8 is successfully installed, you can create and activate your new virtual environment and install dependencies:

Bash

# Navigate to your project directory
cd ~/Desktop/Project-Sentinel

# Create the new environment using pyenv's Python 3.11
pyenv virtualenv 3.11.8 sentinel-env-3.11

# Activate the new environment
pyenv activate sentinel-env-3.11
Your prompt should now show (sentinel-env-3.11).

Finally, install all project dependencies:

Bash

pip install --upgrade pip
pip install google-generativeai python-iptables vt-py tensorflow pandas scikit-learn
