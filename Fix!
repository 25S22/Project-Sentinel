## The Definitive Fix: Manually Disable the Lock File
Step 1: Find the Lock File's Path
First, we need the exact path to the lock file within your active virtual environment.

Action: Make sure your (sentinel-env-3.11) environment is active, then run this command:

Bash

find ~/.pyenv/versions/sentinel-env-3.11 -name "EXTERNALLY-MANAGED"
This will search for the file and print its full path. It will look something like this:
/home/death/.pyenv/versions/sentinel-env-3.11/lib/python3.11/EXTERNALLY-MANAGED

Step 2: Disable the Lock File
Now that you have the path, we will rename the file. This effectively disables it without deleting it, which is a safe practice.

Action: Use the path you just found in the following command. Copy and paste the path carefully.

Bash

# Replace the path with the one you found in Step 1
mv /home/death/.pyenv/versions/sentinel-env-3.11/lib/python3.11/EXTERNALLY-MANAGED /home/death/.pyenv/versions/sentinel-env-3.11/lib/python3.11/EXTERNALLY-MANAGED.bak
This command renames the file to EXTERNALLY-MANAGED.bak. Because pip is only looking for the original name, it will no longer find the lock and the error will be gone.

Step 3: Install Your Dependencies (Finally)
Now, with the lock disabled, pip will work correctly without any special flags.

Action: Run the standard pip install command.

Bash

pip install google-generativeai python-iptables vt-py tensorflow pandas scikit-learn
This will now succeed. You have manually overridden the system's aggressive protection within the safe confines of your virtual environment, clearing the final roadblock.
