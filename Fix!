## The Definitive Fix: Install Python with pyenv
Follow these steps exactly. This will give you a clean, working Python 3.11 installation, allowing you to finally move forward.

Step 1: Install pyenv Dependencies
First, we need to install the libraries that pyenv uses to build Python from source.

Bash

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev \
libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev \
xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev python3-openssl git
Step 2: Install pyenv Itself
This command downloads the pyenv installer and runs it. It will install pyenv safely in your home directory.

Bash

curl https://pyenv.run | bash
Step 3: Configure Your Shell for pyenv
After the installation, you must run these commands to set up the necessary environment variables. This tells your terminal how to find and use pyenv.

Bash

echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo -e 'if command -v pyenv 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then\n  eval "$(pyenv init -)"\nfi' >> ~/.bashrc
Now, close and reopen your terminal for these changes to take effect.

Step 4: Install Python 3.11
With pyenv installed and configured, you can now install Python 3.11 with a simple command. This will download the Python source code and compile it for you. This may take 5-10 minutes.

Bash

pyenv install 3.11.8
Step 5: Create the New Virtual Environment (The Right Way)
Now, use the pyenv-managed Python 3.11 to create a new, clean virtual environment.

Bash

# Navigate to your project directory
cd ~/Desktop/Project-Sentinel

# Use the specific pyenv Python version to create the venv
~/.pyenv/versions/3.11.8/bin/python -m venv sentinel-env-3.11
Step 6: Activate and Install Dependencies
Activate your new, correctly built environment.

Bash

source sentinel-env-3.11/bin/activate
Your prompt will show (sentinel-env-3.11). Now, reinstall everything.

Bash

pip install --upgrade pip
pip install google-generativeai python-iptables vt-py tensorflow
You are now, finally, in a stable, correct environment. You can proceed with running python anomaly_detector.py. This method bypasses all the system-level apt issues and is the guaranteed path forward.
