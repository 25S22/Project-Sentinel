Of course. Since your firewall and IDS are running, the next step is to install a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system. This will give you the central dashboard you need for visualization.

We will use Wazuh, which provides a powerful dashboard to see the alerts from Suricata.

## 1. Defender VM: Install Wazuh SIEM & Dashboard
Run these commands on your Kali Purple (Defender) VM. This single script installs the Wazuh server and the web dashboard.

Bash

# Download and run the all-in-one installation script
curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.7/wazuh-install.sh
sudo bash ./wazuh-install.sh -a
Important: At the end of the installation, it will print the admin password. Copy and save this password.

## 2. Defender VM: Integrate Suricata Logs into Wazuh
Now, tell the Wazuh agent to read the alerts that Suricata generates.

Bash

# Add the Suricata log file location to the Wazuh agent's configuration
echo "
<localfile>
  <log_format>json</log_format>
  <location>/var/log/suricata/eve.json</location>
</localfile>
" | sudo tee -a /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf > /dev/null

# Restart the Wazuh agent to apply the new configuration
sudo systemctl restart wazuh-agent
## 3. Test and Verify on the Dashboard
Your setup is now complete. The final step is to generate an alert and see it appear on your new dashboard.
Access the Dashboard: Open a web browser and go to your Defender VM's IP address: https://192.168.10.3.

Log in with the username admin and the password you saved.

Generate an Alert: From your Attacker VM, run the curl command again.

Bash

curl -A "() { :;}; /bin/bash" http://192.168.10.3
Find the Alert in Wazuh: In the Wazuh dashboard, go to the menu on the top left, then navigate to Modules > Security events. You will see the "Shellshock" alert from Suricata at the top of the list. You can click on it to see all the enriched details.
