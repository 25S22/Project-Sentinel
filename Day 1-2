Lets do it!


Let's get started on Project Sentinel! ðŸš€

Based on our plan, here is a detailed, step-by-step guide for what you can achieve today and tomorrow (Day 1 & Day 2). This plan is designed to be completed in a few hours of focused work and will get your core interactive agent up and running.

Day 1: Environment Setup & First API Call
The goal for today is to set up your Python environment on the Kali VM and make a successful connection to the Gemini API.

Step 1: Get Your API Key Securely
If you haven't already, generate your Gemini API key from Google AI Studio. Crucially, do not hardcode this key in your script. The best practice is to set it as an environment variable in your terminal. This is a key part of your security narrative.

Bash

# This sets the key in your current terminal session
export GEMINI_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'

# To make this permanent, add the line above to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc file
# Then, reload your shell: source ~/.bashrc
Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment
This is a critical step to avoid the externally-managed-environment error and keep your project dependencies isolated.

Bash

# Create a virtual environment named 'sentinel-env'
python3 -m venv sentinel-env

# Activate the environment
source sentinel-env/bin/activate
(Your terminal prompt should now show (sentinel-env) indicating the environment is active.)

Step 3: Install the Necessary Library
We'll use Google's official Python SDK to interact with the Gemini API.

Bash

# Install the library
pip install google-generativeai
Step 4: Write and Run Your First Script
This will be a simple test to ensure everything is working correctly.

Create a file named day1.py with the following code.

Python

import google.generativeai as genai
import os

# Configure the API key from the environment variable
api_key = os.getenv("GEMINI_API_KEY")
if not api_key:
    raise ValueError("GEMINI_API_KEY not found. Please set the environment variable.")
genai.configure(api_key=api_key)

# Get a Gemini model
model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')

# Send a prompt to the model and print the response
response = model.generate_content("What is the role of an agentic AI in cybersecurity?")
print("Sentinel's Initial Response:")
print(response.text)
Now, run the script from your terminal.

Bash

python3 day1.py
Expected Output: You should see a coherent response from Gemini explaining the concept of agentic AI in cybersecurity. This confirms your setup is correct and you can proceed to the next phase.

Day 2: Building the Interactive Agent
Today, we will build the core interactive loop of your agent and implement the basic command-line logic for the check_reputation function.

Step 1: The Interactive Terminal Loop
This is the code for the conversational interface. Create a new file named sentinel.py.

Python

import google.generativeai as genai
import os
import sys

# Configure the API key
api_key = os.getenv("GEMINI_API_KEY")
if not api_key:
    raise ValueError("GEMINI_API_KEY not found. Please set the environment variable.")
genai.configure(api_key=api_key)

# The core conversational model
model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')

# Hardcoded knowledge base for the demonstration
threat_intel = {
    "malware-site.com": {
        "status": "malicious",
        "sha256": "5f6b89a0b1c2d3e4f5a6b7c8d9e0f1a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b9c0d1e2f3a4b5c6d7e8",
        "description": "Known malware distribution site."
    },
    "phishing-scam.net": {
        "status": "phishing",
        "sha256": "a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6e7f8a9b0c1d2e3f4a5b6c7d8e9f0a1b2",
        "description": "Known credential-stealing site."
    },
    "safe-website.com": {
        "status": "safe",
        "sha256": "n/a",
        "description": "Verified legitimate website."
    }
}

print("Sentinel: Greetings, I am your personal defensive agent. How can I assist you?")

while True:
    user_input = input("You > ")
    if user_input.lower() in ['exit', 'quit']:
        print("Sentinel: Shutting down. Goodbye!")
        break

    # Check for specific, hardcoded commands
    if user_input.lower().startswith("check_reputation"):
        parts = user_input.split()
        if len(parts) < 2:
            print("Sentinel: Please provide a URL to check. Usage: check_reputation <URL>")
            continue
        
        url_to_check = parts[1]
        
        if url_to_check in threat_intel:
            threat_data = threat_intel[url_to_check]
            print(f"Sentinel: My analysis shows that {url_to_check} is {threat_data['status']}.")
            print(f"Sentinel: Description: {threat_data['description']}")
            print(f"Sentinel: SHA256: {threat_data['sha256']}")
        else:
            # If not in our hardcoded list, ask the AI for a general response
            response = model.generate_content(f"I found no known threats for {url_to_check}. Can you provide a general overview of this URL?")
            print(f"Sentinel: {response.text}")
    else:
        # For other questions, pass the query directly to the AI
        try:
            response = model.generate_content(user_input)
            print(f"Sentinel: {response.text}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Sentinel: An error occurred while processing your request: {e}")
Step 2: Install python-iptables and Connect the Logic
This is the most critical part of the orchestration. You will need to install the Python library for iptables and add the logic to your script.

Bash

# Activate your environment if it's not already
source sentinel-env/bin/activate

# Install the iptables library
pip install python-iptables
Now, modify your sentinel.py script to include the "human-in-the-middle" logic. This will involve using the socket library to get an IP address and the iptc library (from python-iptables) to manage the firewall rules.

Python

# Add these imports at the top of your sentinel.py script
import socket
import iptc # This is from the python-iptables library

# Inside your `if url_to_check in threat_intel:` block, replace the `print` statements with this:
if url_to_check in threat_intel:
    threat_data = threat_intel[url_to_check]
    print(f"Sentinel: My analysis shows that {url_to_check} is {threat_data['status']}.")
    print(f"Sentinel: Description: {threat_data['description']}")
    print(f"Sentinel: SHA256: {threat_data['sha256']}")
    
    # Human-in-the-middle confirmation
    confirmation = input("Sentinel: Would you like me to block this threat? (yes/no) > ")
    if confirmation.lower() == 'yes':
        try:
            # A simple way to get the IP from the URL for this demo
            ip_to_block = socket.gethostbyname(url_to_check)
            
            # Use iptc to add the firewall rule
            table = iptc.Table(iptc.Table.FILTER)
            chain = iptc.Chain(table, "INPUT")
            
            rule = iptc.Rule()
            rule.src = ip_to_block
            rule.target = iptc.Target(rule, "DROP")
            chain.insert_rule(rule)
            table.commit()

            print(f"Sentinel: Success! The IP address {ip_to_block} has been added to the firewall drop list.")
            # Future-proof: add a log entry here
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Sentinel: An error occurred while trying to block the IP: {e}. Please ensure you have root permissions.")
    else:
        print("Sentinel: Understood. No action will be taken.")
